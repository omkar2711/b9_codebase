useMemo and useCallback are used for performance optimization in React applications. 
They help to prevent unnecessary re-renders and improve 
the efficiency of your components.

useRef is used to create a mutable reference that persists across re-renders.
It can be used to access DOM elements directly or to store mutable values that do not 
trigger re-renders when updated.
